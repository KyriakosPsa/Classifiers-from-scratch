# Building Classifiers from scratch

This work is one of a series of two distinct repositories that collectively constitute the coursework focused on Classical Machine Learning methods for the Data Science & Information Technologies masters course: Μ124 - Machine Learning at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA) during the Fall 2022 semester. The other repository deals with [Regression from scratch](https://github.com/KyriakosPsa/Regression-from-scratch).

# Overview

The classifiers implemented are the following:
---
- A k-nearest neighbours (k-NN) classifier, allowing for the selection of the distance metric between euclidean distance, manhattan distance, Mahalanobis distance and Chebyshev distance.
- A Bayesian classifier, able to utilize different assumptions about the covariance of the features:
  - diagonal covariance matrices
  - non-diagonal covariance matrices
  - Components of the feature vectors that are mutually statistically independent (Naïve Bayes approach)
- Finally, the single-layer perceptron algorithm was implemented.
